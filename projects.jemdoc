== Ongoing Projects

~
- *Develop [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reyCgdOuSWo Ballbot]'s Controller using reinforcement learning methods*
-- The ballbot is built by Do Van Thach, a PhD student at Kyung Hee university
-- Trying to use various reinforcement learning approaches to develop/enhance the controller of Ballbot
-- Potential approaches: meta learning, policy search, PID-based reinfrocement learning, ...

~
- *Keep track achievements from Google DeepMind, OpenAI in AI Games*
-- AI has already beat humans at Chess and Go
-- The next level of AI will be high-quality video games such as [https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/ DotA 2], [https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2 Starcraft II]. Let's see!
-- [https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/ DotA 2] and [https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2 Starcraft II] is more difficult than Chess or Go due to:
--- A lot of states and actions
--- The AI agent plans under partial observability
--- Multiple agent

- *Health monitoring application*
-- /*Future Internet*/ by Prof. [http://networking.khu.ac.kr/layouts/net/members/mem01.htm Choong Seon Hong]
-- Application features:
--- IBM Internet of Thing, turn your mobile device into a sensor
--- MQTT: A machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. I use free MQTT server iot.eclipse.org, port 1883
--- Measure heartbeat rate using iPhone camera.
--- There have 2 iOS Applications:
---- Patient application is installed on patient's iPhone. It allows:
----- measure heartbeat and sent it to a doctor.
----- send GPS Coordinates to the doctor.
----- send an emergency call to the doctor.
----- receive recommendations from the doctor.
---- Doctor application is installed on doctor's iPhone. It allows:
----- visualize heartbeat rate in a graph.
----- show location of the patient on the map.
----- show an alert to doctor after patient made an emergency call.
---- Supported iOS version: 8.3
---- Supported iPhone: iPhone 5/5s
-- Report and code can be found [https://github.com/lephamtuyen/healthmonitoring here].
