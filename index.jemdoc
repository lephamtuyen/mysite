== About Me
I am a fifth year Ph.D. student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Kyung Hee University. I work in the area of Machine Learning with Prof. *[https://vienngo.github.io/index.html Ngo Anh Vien]* and *[https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/c/Chung:TaeChoong TaeChoong Chung]*. I am particularly interested in Reinforcement Learning applied to games and robotics. My research ideas touch the areas of developing deep reinforcement learning algorithms to deal with hierarchical and partially observable tasks. I have recently been focusing on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms dealing with hierarchical and partially observable tasks.

In the past, I completed my bachelor degree in HoChiMinh City University of Technology (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) where I worked with Prof. *[http://www.cse.hcmut.edu.vn/~khanh/ Dang Tran Khanh]* on developing biometric apps for smartphone security. I spent most of my childhood in the peaceful country [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph%C3%BA_Y%C3%AAn_Province Phu Yen] and then spent five years of my life at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City Ho Chi Minh City] before moving to Korea to start my Ph.D.
